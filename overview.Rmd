## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, out.width = "50%"}


# PLOT - wetland & peatland area 
#source('./plots/lin_plot_stocker_sum_wet_peat_area.r')


img1_path <- "C:/Users/efluet/Dropbox/Chap3_holocene_global_wetland_loss/output/figures/line_plot_sum_nat_wet_20th.png"
img1 <- readPNG(img1_path, native = TRUE, info = TRUE)
include_graphics(img1_path)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%"}

img1_path <- "C:/Users/efluet/Dropbox/Chap3_holocene_global_wetland_loss/output/figures/gif/wetloss.gif"
#img1 <- readPNG(img1_path, native = TRUE, info = TRUE)
include_graphics(img1_path)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
